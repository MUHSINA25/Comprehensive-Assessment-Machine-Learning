# Comprehensive-Assessment-Machine-Learning
# **Car Price Prediction Project**

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting car prices using machine learning models. The project is focused on understanding the factors that influence car prices in the American market.

## **Overview**

A Chinese automobile company is planning to enter the US market and seeks insights into car pricing. The objectives are to:

- Identify significant variables affecting car prices.
- Build predictive models using various regression algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance using R-squared, MSE, and MAE.
- Analyze feature importance and perform hyperparameter tuning.

## **Implemented Models**

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor**

## **Dataset**

The dataset used is `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`, which includes various features related to car specifications. The target variable is the car price.

## **Structure**

- **`CarPrice_Assignment.csv`**: Dataset.
- **`Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MUHSINA25/CarPrice_Prediction.git
