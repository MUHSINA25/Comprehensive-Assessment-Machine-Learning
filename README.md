# **Car Price Prediction Project**

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting car prices using machine learning models. The goal is to understand factors influencing car prices and to build models to estimate these prices effectively.

## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset, containing various features related to car specifications and their corresponding prices, was loaded for analysis. Preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical features.

These steps ensured the data was in the optimal format for model training. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets for evaluating model performance.

## 2. Model Implementation

Five different regression algorithms were implemented to predict car prices:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective model to understand the linear relationship between features and car prices.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**: A non-linear model that creates a tree structure to make predictions based on decision rules inferred from the data.
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve prediction accuracy.
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.
5. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**: A model that fits the data within a certain margin, optimizing for the best boundary.

## 3. Model Evaluation

Each model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **R-squared**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

These metrics provided insights into the accuracy and robustness of each model. The comparison of these metrics allowed for identifying the best-performing model, which was found to be the Random Forest Regressor.

## 4. Feature Importance Analysis

An analysis was conducted to determine which variables significantly impact car prices. Feature importance was evaluated using:
- Feature importance scores from ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting).
- Correlation analysis.

This step provided valuable insights into which features are most influential in determining car prices.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

The best-performing model underwent hyperparameter tuning to further enhance its performance. Techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search were used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters, resulting in improved model accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning models to predict car prices, evaluates their performance, and identifies key factors influencing pricing. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the best model, ensuring the highest accuracy in predictions.
