# **Car Price Prediction Project**

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting car prices using machine learning models. The project is focused on understanding the factors that influence car prices in the American market.

## **Overview**

A Chinese automobile company is planning to enter the US market and seeks insights into car pricing. The objectives are to:

- Identify significant variables affecting car prices.
- Build predictive models using various regression algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance using R-squared, MSE, and MAE.
- Analyze feature importance and perform hyperparameter tuning.

## **Implemented Models**

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor**

## **Dataset**

the dataset used for the project is [CarPrice Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link)

## **Structure**

- **`CarPrice_Assignment.csv`**: Dataset.
- **`Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.
